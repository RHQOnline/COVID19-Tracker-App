# RHQOnline's COVID19 / nCov / Coronavirus Tracker
Track live, up-to-date statistics of COVID19 from a Python Application.

## Installation
Download the binary from the [releases](https://github.com/RHQOnline/COVID19-Tracker-App/releases/latest/) page, and simply run it.

## Contributing
Fork the program and make a pull request. Pull requests will be reviewed and updated as needed.

## Security
The program (at this time) throws a false-flag detection on most antiviruses. This is because it uses the 'requests' module. If you have trust issues with the binary, download and compile the sourcecode yourself.
